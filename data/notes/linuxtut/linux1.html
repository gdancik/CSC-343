<h1>LINUX Tutorial One </h1>

<h2>1.1 Listing files and directories </h2>
<h3>ls (list) </h3>
<p> When you first login to a linux terminal, your current working directory is usually your home directory. However, in our case we log into the docker container as <i>root</i> (the admin user), and start at the the topmost directory, denoted as /). 
<p> To find out what is in this directory, type </p>
<p class="command"># ls </p> 
<p>The <samp>ls</samp> command lists the contents of your current working directory (ls is short for list).  
</p>
<p> There may be no files visible in the current directory, in which case the LINUX 
  prompt will be returned. Alternatively, there may already be some files in this directory (the topmost 
  <i>root</i> directory will always contain system-wide files and directories. </p>

<p><samp>ls</samp> does not, in fact, cause all the files in the current directory 
  to be listed, but only those whose names do not begin with a dot (.) Files 
  beginning with a dot are known as hidden files and usually contain important 
  program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change 
  them unless you are very familiar with LINUX!!! </p>
<p> To list all files in your home directory including those whose names begin 
  with a dot, type </p>
<p class="command"># ls -a</p>
<p> <samp>ls</samp> is an example of a command which can take options: <samp>-a</samp> 
  is an example of an option. The options change the behaviour of the command. 
  There are online manual pages that tell you which options a particular command 
  can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. (Online manual pages are described more in Tutorial Four) </p>
<h2>1.2 Making Directories </h2>
  
<h3>mkdir (make directory) </h3>
<p> We will now make a subdirectory in the current directory. To make a subdirectory called <samp>linuxstuff</samp> in your current working directory type </p>
<p class="command"># mkdir linuxstuff </p>
<p> To see the directory you have just created, type </p>
<p class="command"># ls</p>
<h2>1.3 Changing to a different directory&nbsp;</h2>
    
<h3>cd (change directory)</h3>
<p> The command <samp>cd <var>directory</var></samp> means change the current 
  working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought 
  of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system 
  tree. </p>
<p> To change to the directory you have just made, type </p>
<p class="command"># cd linuxstuff </p>
<p> Type <samp>ls</samp> to see the contents (which should be empty) </p>
<h3>Exercise 1a</h3>
<p>Make another directory inside the <strong>linuxstuff</strong> directory called 
  <strong>backups</strong> </p>
<h2>1.4 The directories . and .. </h2>
<p> Still in the <strong>linuxstuff</strong> directory, type </p>
<p class="command"> # ls -a </p>
<p> As you can see, in the <strong>linuxstuff</strong> directory (and in all other 
  directories), there are two special directories called (<strong>.</strong>) 
  and (<strong>..</strong>)</p>
<p> In LINUX, (<strong>.</strong>) means the current directory, so typing </p>
<p class="command"> # cd . </p>
<p> means stay where you are (i.e., in the <strong>linuxstuff</strong> directory). </p>
<p>This may not seem very useful at first, but using (<strong>.</strong>) as the 
  name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later 
  in the tutorial. </p>
<p> The parent of the current directory is (<strong>..</strong>), so typing 
</p>
<p class="command"> # cd .. </p>
<p> will take you one directory up the hierarchy (i.e., the parent directory of the current one). 
  Try it now. </p>
<p> Note: typing <samp>cd</samp> with no argument always returns you to your home 
directory (/root in our case). Typing <samp> cd /</samp> will return you to the topmost directory (for us, this is very useful as it will return us to the original directory we start in when we run a shell in a new container).</p>
<h2>1.5 Pathnames </h2>
<h3>pwd (print working directory) </h3>
<p> Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole file-system. 
  For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your home-directory, type 
  <samp>cd</samp> to get back to your home-directory and then type </p>
<p class="command"> # pwd </p>
<p> The full pathname should read - </p>
<p class = "stdout"> /root</p>
<h3>Exercise 1b</h3>
<p>Use the commands <samp>ls</samp>, <samp>pwd</samp> and <samp>cd</samp> to explore 
  the file system. </p>
<p> (Remember, if you get lost, type <samp>cd /</samp> to return to the 
  directory we started in) </p>
<h2>1.6 More about home directories and pathnames </h2>
<h3>Understanding pathnames</h3>
<p>First type <samp>cd /</samp> to get back to the topmost directory, then type</p>
<p class="command"> # ls linuxstuff</p>
<p>to list the conents of your linuxstuff directory.</p>
<p>Now type </p>
<p class="command"> # ls backups</p>
<p> You will get a message like this - </p>
<p class="stdout"> ls: cannot access backups: No such file or directory </p>
<p> The reason is, <strong>backups</strong> is not in your current working directory. 
  To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory 
  (the directory you are currently in), you must either <samp>cd</samp> to the 
  correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your 
  backups directory, you must type </p>
<p class="command"> # ls linuxstuff/backups</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>~ (your home directory) </h3>
<p>Home directories can also be referred to by the tilde (<strong>~</strong>) character. 
  It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing </p>
<p class="command"> # ls ~</p>
<p> will list the contents of your home directory (/root), no matter where you currently 
  are in the file system. </p>
<p> What do you think </p>
<p class="command"> # ls ~/.. </p>
<p> would list? </p>

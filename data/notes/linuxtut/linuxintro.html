  <h1>UNIX/LINUX Introduction </h1>
</div>
<p>This session concerns UNIX/LINUX, which is a common operating system. By operating 
  system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. UNIX is often used in workstations and servers. Mac OS X is a UNIX operating system. Linux operating systems, though technically not UNIX, are extremely similar and are considered "UNIX-like". All aspects of this tutorial apply to both UNIX and Linux operating systems, though in most cases we will only mention LINUX for brevity. In this class, your Docker container will be running CentOS Linux (which itself is derived from Red Had Enterprise Linux) which is what we will use to work with Hadoop. </p>
  
<h2>The LINUX operating system </h2>
<p>The LINUX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell, 
  and the programs. </p>
<h3>The kernel </h3>
<p>The kernel of LINUX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and 
  memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response 
  to system calls. </p>
<p> As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, 
  suppose a user types <samp>rm myfile</samp> (which has the effect of removing 
  the file <strong>myfile</strong>). The shell searches the filestore (i.e., the list of files on the computer) for the 
  file containing the program <samp>rm</samp>, and then requests the kernel, through 
  system calls, to execute the program <samp>rm</samp> on myfile. When the process 
  <samp>rm myfile</samp> has finished running, the shell then returns the LINUX
  prompt to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands. </p>
<h3>The shell</h3>
<p>The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user 
  logs in, the login program checks the username and password. When the user opens a terminal, the kernel starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). 
  It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried 
  out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives 
  the user another prompt ($ on our systems). </p>
<p> The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different 
  shells on the same machine. We will be using the <i>bash</i> shell 
  by default. </p>
<p> The bash shell has certain features to help the user inputting commands.</p>
<p> Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or 
  directory and pressing the [Tab] key, the bash shell will complete the rest 
  of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with 
  those letters you have typed, it will beep; pressing tab again will then display all names that match. </p>
<p> History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you 
  need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list 
  or type history for a list of previous commands. </p>
    
<p> </p>
<h2>Files and processes </h2>
<p>Everything in LINUX is either a file or a process. </p>
<p> A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). 
</p>
<p> A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, 
  running compilers etc. </p>
<p> Examples of files: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a document (report, essay etc.) </li>
  <li> the text of a program written in some high-level programming language </li>
  <li> instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible 
    to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable 
    or binary file); </li>
  <li> a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a 
    mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files. </li>
</ul>
  
<p> </p>
<h2>The Directory Structure </h2>
<p>All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system 
  is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the 
  hierarchy is traditionally called <strong>root</strong>. </p>

</p>
<p> In the diagram above, we see that the directory ee51ab contains the subdirectory 
  unixstuff and a file proj.txt</p>
  
<h2>Starting an terminal session </h2>
<p>In our case, we will start a terminal session by running a bash shell within a docker container, e.g., by typing <samp>docker run -it centos bash</samp> in the terminal or command line of your host machine. 
<p> A terminal window will appear with a prompt, waiting for 
  you to start entering commands.</p>
<p> The command prompt, which will have the form</p>
<p><i>[root@7a739628b4b1 Desktop]#</i></p>
<p>
is configured to take the form [user@hostname current_directory]#. </p><p>Here, the user is root@7a739628b4b1 and the current directory is /home/cloudera/Desktop (though only the last level of the directory structure is shown). Note that the hostname is the same as the docker container ID. The prompt ends with a number sign (#). In the tutorials that follow, the command prompt will be denoted only by the # sign, for simplicity.

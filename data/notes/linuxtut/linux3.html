<h1>LINUX Tutorial Three </h1>

<h2>3.1 Redirection &nbsp; </h2>
<p>Most processes initiated by LINUX commands write to the standard output (that 
  is, they write to the terminal screen), and many take their input from the standard 
  input (that is, they read it from the keyboard). There is also the standard 
  error, where processes write their error messages, by default, to the terminal 
  screen. </p>
<p> We have already seen one use of the <samp>cat</samp> command to write the 
  contents of a file to the screen. </p>
<p> Now type <samp>cat</samp> without specifing a file to read </p>

<p class="command"> # cat</p>
<p>Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the <samp>[Enter]</samp> key. 
</p>
<p> Finally hold the <samp>[Ctrl]</samp> key down and press <samp>d</samp> (written 
  as ^D for short) to end the input. </p>
<p> What has happened? </p>
<p> If you run the <samp>cat</samp> command without specifing a file to read, 
  it reads the standard input (the keyboard), and on receiving the 'return' key or the 'end of file' 
  (^D), copies it to the standard output (the screen). </p>
<p> In LINUX, we can redirect both the input and the output of commands. </p>
  <p> </p>
<h2>3.2 Redirecting the Output &nbsp; </h2>
<p>We use the <samp>&gt;</samp> symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, move to your linuxstuff directory. Then, to 
  create a file called <strong>list1</strong> containing a list of fruit, type 
  &nbsp; </p>
<p class="command"> # cat &gt; list1</p>
<p>Then type in the names of some fruit. Press <samp>[Enter]</samp> after each 
  one. </p>
<p class="command"> pear<br />
  banana<br />
  apple<br />
  ^D (Control D to stop)</p>
<p>What happens is the <samp>cat</samp> command reads the standard input (the 
  keyboard) and the <samp>&gt;</samp> redirects the output, which normally goes to the screen, 
  into a file called <strong>list1</strong>. </p>
<p> To read the contents of the file, type </p>

<p class="command"> # cat list1</p>

<h3>Exercise 3a</h3>

<p>Using the above method, create another file called <strong>list2</strong> containing 
  the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. Read the contents of <strong>list2</strong> 
</p>
<hr>

<p>The symbol <samp>&gt;&gt;</samp> appends standard output to a file. So to add more items to 
  the file <strong>list1</strong>, type </p>
<p class="command"> # cat &gt;&gt; list1</p>
<p>Then type in the names of more fruit </p>

<p class="command"> peach<br />
  grape<br />
  orange<br />
  ^D (Control D to stop)</p>
<p>To read the contents of the file, type </p>

<p class="command"> # cat list1</p>

<p>You should now have two files. One contains six fruit, the other contains four 
  fruit. We will now use the <samp>cat</samp> command to join (concatenate) <strong>list1</strong> 
  and <strong>list2</strong> into a new file called <strong>biglist</strong>. 
  Type </p>

<p class="command"> # cat list1 list2 &gt; biglist</p>
<p>What this is doing is reading the contents of <strong>list1</strong> and <strong>list2</strong> 
  in turn, then outputing the text to the file <strong>biglist</strong>. </p>
<p> To read the contents of the new file, type </p>
<p class="command"> # cat biglist</p>


<h2>3.3 Redirecting the Input &nbsp; </h2>
<p>We use the <samp>&lt;</samp> symbol to redirect the input of a command. </p>
<p> The command <samp>sort</samp> alphabetically or numerically sorts a list. 
  Type </p>

<p class="command"> # sort </p>
<p> Then type in the names of some vegetables. Press <samp>[Enter]</samp> after 
  each one. </p>

<p class="command"> carrot<br />
  beetroot<br />
  artichoke<br />
  ^D (control d to stop)<br />
</p>
<p> The output will be </p>

<p class="stdout"> artichoke<br />
  beetroot <br />
  carrot </p>
<p> Using <samp>&lt;</samp> you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the 
  keyboard. For example, to sort the list of fruit, type </p>

<p class="command"> # sort &lt; biglist </p>
<p> and the sorted list will be output to the screen. </p>
<p> To output the sorted list to a file, type, </p>

<p class="command"> # sort &lt; biglist &gt; slist </p>
<p> Use <samp>cat</samp> to read the contents of the file <strong>slist</strong>. 
</p>


<h2>3.4 Pipes</h2>
<p> We have already seen the <samp>ls</samp> command for getting a file listing.</p> 
<p class="command"> # ls</p>
<p>By default, this returns the files in sorted order, however the sorting is case-sensitive. </p>
<p>One method to get a sorted list of file names, ignoring case, is to type, </p>
<p class="command"> # ls &gt; files.txt<br />
  # sort -f &lt; files.txt </p>
<p>The -f flag in the <samp> sort -f</samp> command specifies that we will ignore case. However, this redirection approach is a bit slow and you have to remember to remove the temporary file called 
  files.txt when you have finished. What you really want to do is connect the output 
  of the <samp>ls</samp> command directly to the input of the <samp>sort</samp> 
  command. This is exactly what pipes do. The symbol for a pipe is the vertical 
  bar (<samp>|</samp>). </p>
<p> For example, typing </p>

<p class="command"> # ls | sort -f</p>
<p>will give the same result as above, but quicker and cleaner. </p>
<p> To find out how many (non-hidden) files are in the current directory, type </p>
<p class="command"> # ls | wc -l <br />
</p>
<p> Note that a single command can apply multiple pipes. For example,</p>
<p class = "command"> # cat list1 list2 | grep "p" | wc -l </p>
<p> will display the number of lines containing the letter "p" in files list1 and list2.</p> 
<h3>Exercise 3b</h3>
<p> Using pipes, print all lines of <strong>/var/log/yum.log</strong>  
  containing the word "fire", and sort the result.</p>
  <p> </p>
<p> </p>

# CSC 343, Lab #3: Python

# Directions: Modify the code below, and turn in a hardcopy 
# of your code on the due date.


# 1. For the string below, output the following, using slicing for (b)-(c)

#   (a) The entire string

#   (b) The first 7 characters

#   (c) The last 10 characters

#   (d) The first 7 characters in reverse

school = "Eastern Connecticut State University"


# 2. (a) add "Big" and "Data" to the list of words below.

#    (b) Use a loop to iterate through the each words. For each word, output
#        the word and its length in the format word: length.

words = ["Eastern", "Connecticut", "State", "University"]


# 3. A few sentences from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by Frank L. Baum,
#    are stored in the string below. For this question, you should use
#    the fact that each sentence ends with a period. 

wizard_of_oz = """Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, 
with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  
Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one
room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for
the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry 
and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in
another corner."""

#  (a) Output the number of lines of text, based on the number of
#      newline characters ('\n') in the string

#  (b)) Output the number of sentences 

#  (c) Output the number of words in each sentence

#  (d) Output the sentences that mention "Dorothy"

#  (e) Create a list of unique words that begin with a capital letter. In 
#      order to do this, remove all commas from the text (otherwise "Em,"
#      and "Em" will be listed as separate words). Note that each word 
#      should only appear once in your final list.
